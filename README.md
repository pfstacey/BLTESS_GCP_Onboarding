## Hello, eager astronomer! 

Welcome to Breakthrough Listen's Virtual Sandbox where you now have access to 60 million TESS light curves (calibrated by the Goddard Team). 

### Step 1: Follow all the steps in the Guide_to_Creating_a_VM_in_BLs_Sandbox.pdf
#### This guide explains everything from how to create a virtual machine to how to open jupyter notebook within that machine


### Step 2: Use the script within this git repository to open your first TESS light curve on your virtual machine with BL's Virtual Sandbox.
#### This is the fun part! Now you can play around. Enjoy :)
