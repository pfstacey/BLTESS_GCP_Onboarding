# BLTESS_GCP_Onboarding

##Hello, eager astronomer! 

Welcome to Breakthrough Listen's Virtual Sandbox where you now have access to 60 million TESS light curves (calibrated by the Goddard Team). Use the script within this git repository to open your first TESS light curve on your virtual machine with BL's Virtual Sandbox. I would recommend doing this within a Jupyter Notebook and if you have followed my tutorial thus far, you should have access to how to do this. 

###Best,

P.S. 
I hope the world is looking better than it is right now. I hope the world found a COVID-19 vaccine.
